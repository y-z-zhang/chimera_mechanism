# Julia code to explore the dynamics and mechanism of strong chimeras

This repository is part of the paper: Y. Zhang and A. E. Motter, _Mechanism for Strong Chimeras_, [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126 094101 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.094101).

To run the code interactively, it is recommended to use [Atom](https://atom.io) + [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen) + [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl). All code were tested on Julia v1.5.2.

The repository includes:
1. `reduced_model.jl`

  _Simulating strong chimeras in two-cluster networks and their quotient networks._

2. `optoelectronic.jl`

  _Simulating strong chimeras in small ring networks of optoelectronic oscillators._
