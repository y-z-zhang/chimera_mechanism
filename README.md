# Julia code to explore the dynamics and mechanism of strong chimeras

This repository is part of the paper: Y. Zhang and A. E. Motter, _Mechanism for Strong Chimeras_.

To run the code interactively, it is recommended to use [Atom](https://atom.io) + [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen) + [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl). Tested on Julia v1.5.2.

It includes:
1. reduced_model.jl

  _Simulating strong chimeras in quotient networks._

2. electro-optic.jl

  _Simulating strong chimeras in two-cluster networks of optoelectronic oscillators._
